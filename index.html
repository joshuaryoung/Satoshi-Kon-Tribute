          Two of Kon's films particularly embody his unique vision: His directorial debut <span class="text-primary">

          Perfect Blue</span> follows the protagonist, Mima, on a journey of self actualization as she decides to leave the J-pop trio that has skyrocketed her to fame and explore more mainstream veins of the entertainment industry. In doing so, she discovers that the pressures to conform to society's expectations for women and its constant gaze are not limited to the pop idol industry. Slowly, Mima is increasingly unable to distinguish her on-screen performances from her real world identity. Kon uses subversions of the established toolkit of film to not simply communicate Mima's descent into delusion, but to take the audience with there with her. By the end of the run-time, the viewer is a full vicar for Mima's break from reality; experiencing every painful break in her reality as she does.

          <p class="text-justify"><span class="lead text-danger">Paprika</span> is the story of detective Konakawa's efforts to understand a recurring nightmare and its anxiety-inducing effect on his waking life. With the aid of a futuristic technology called the "DC Mini", his therapist Dr. Chiba is able to enter his dreams as an alter ego Paprika and jointly work on unravelling the meaning behind them. When a prototype DC Mini is stolen, detective Konakawa is enlisted to track down not only the device, but apprehend the thief who has begun to infiltrate and manipulate the minds of the collegues of Dr. Chiba. Engaging, once again, with narrative convention in surrealistic ways, Kon immerses the viewer in the various states of conciousness experienced by his characters. The rich and purposeful use of color and kinematics are also key to the effective sense of habitable spaces and human feeling characters. Ideas are conveyed clearly through subtle shifts in these elements eliminating the need for anything but minimal exposition.</p>
